        <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">We partner with schools to transform them into centres of excellence by implementing LEAD School's integrated system. Our only primary requirement from a school is for it to have a building, transport, furniture, teachers and students. LEAD School's integrated system takes care of everything else for all the stakeholders involved. Through our integrated suite of courseware, software and hardware, we implement a full-stack system in schools. This transformation happens at a cost that is lower than what a school would pay to different vendors/partners to get these benefits.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag  text-small">Findings are reported through four key themes: experiences of disability, inclusion, learning and developmental progress; factors influencing non-enrolment and absenteeism; barriers to learning and progress; and accountability and support channels. Five key components were highlighted: 1) relevance of peer interactions for learning outcomes and wellbeing; 2) the importance of the CBCC as (a model for) a safe space against discrimination; 3) relevance of quality education and pre-school teacher training; 4) necessity of material support to decrease absenteeism</p>
